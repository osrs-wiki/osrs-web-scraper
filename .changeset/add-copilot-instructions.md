Add comprehensive GitHub Copilot instructions for development workflow

Added `.github/copilot-instructions.md` with detailed instructions for GitHub Copilot agents working in the osrs-web-scraper codebase, including:

- Complete development workflow with validated command timings
- Repository structure guide and key configuration files
- CLI usage examples using development mode (`npm run start`)
- Browser requirements and Puppeteer limitations
- Code quality requirements and CI/CD workflow information
- Known limitations and debugging instructions

This improves the development experience by providing GitHub Copilot with comprehensive context about the project structure, commands, and best practices.
