{{PollDescription|Previous skills have come with resources that support their unique gameplay. We've striven to make Sailing feel authentically Old School with this same kind of progression and new, thematic resources.

Many materials will be introduced as core parts of the new skill for which you already voted, but it's up to you how they should affect other parts of the game.

We think they'd add value to existing skills like Mining and Woodcutting, so we'd like to offer them as updates to those skills. However they could be obtained in other ways, such as purely via Sailing activities.

Some content may be delivered after the initial launch depending on development time, player feedback, and overall project scope.

This poll closes on Thursday 14th August.}}
